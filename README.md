# RAG App

This is a simple web application that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on uploaded documents.

Users can upload files such as PDFs or text documents, ask questions about them, and get responses generated by an AI model. The app retrieves relevant parts of the document and sends them to the model to improve accuracy.

Useful for quickly understanding long documents or finding specific information.
